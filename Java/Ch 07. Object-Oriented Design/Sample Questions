Design a call center such that:

1. There are three kinds of employees: Respondants, Managers and Directors
2. When a call comes then it is allocated to the Respondants first
3. If no Respondant is free or not able to handle it then its escalated to Managers.
4. If no Manager is free or not able to handle it then its escalated to Directors.

Each song has an Artist
For playlist, the first song is played and other songs are added to the queue
Relation between playlist and songs is many-to-many
Relation between Song and Artist is Many-to-one
